## 📝 Notes

- Website builder is fully integrated into tab structure
- All new pages use dark premium theme
- Regeneration limits are enforced server-side
- Completion state syncs across page refreshes

## 🐛 Known Limitations

2. "67" branding not added yet
3. Hosting option not in checkout
4. Some UI could be more polished (fonts, animations)
5. Old dashboard page should be deprecated/removed

**Ready to Continue?**

We can:
1. **Continue with remaining tasks** (credits, multi-dashboard, premium UI, hosting)
2. **Test what's built so far** (deploy and walk through user journey)
3. **Refine existing features** (polish animations, improve copy)

Your choice! 🚀
